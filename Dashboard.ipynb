Users can view a summary of their data, such as age, occupation, annual income, and credit-related information, and then make modifications directly through input fields. The interface includes dropdowns for categorical features (e.g., occupation, payment behavior) and sliders for continuous features like credit history age.\n",

So we advise you to run the **app.py** on python script and type 'streamlit run app.py' in terminal to launch for easier use."
